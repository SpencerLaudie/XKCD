# Vue XKCD Browser

This was an assignment for my web development class in which I used Vue to build an application that uses
an API to browse XKCD comics. Because there is no backend, this site will not save comments or ratings. You can see the final product at [xkcd.slaudie.com](http://xkcd.slaudie.com)
